🦅 fedora-phoenix
Nuke your OS. Keep your soul.

A single-binary, zero-dependency provisioning tool dedicated to Fedora Linux.

📖 The "Why"
I break my Fedora setup—often. Whether it's kernel experiments or messing with runtimes, I need the ability to wipe my root partition (/) and start fresh without hesitation.

I tried Shell Scripts: brittle, hard to handle errors, spaghetti code. I tried Ansible: slow, requires installing Python/pip first, YAML hell, and feels like killing a fly with a bazooka.

fedora-phoenix is the answer. It treats your laptop infrastructure as code, but real code (Go), not configuration files.

✨ Key Features (The Selling Points)
🚀 Zero Dependency (Single Binary)
No Python. No Pip. No Git required to start. Just wget the binary, chmod +x, and run. It carries its own logic and "playbooks" (compiled Go code). It bootstraps the system from a fresh install to a fully operational dev environment.

🛡️ LUKS-Aware & Secure
Designed for the Framework Laptop (and similar setups) with a split partition strategy:

Root (/): Ephemeral, formatted on every reinstall.

Work (/dev/nvme0n1p4): LUKS encrypted, persistent. Phoenix handles the decryption (securely in RAM), unlocking, and mounting of your persistent data, seamlessly bind-mounting it back to your $HOME.

🐧 Fedora Native & Unapologetic
We don't support Ubuntu, Arch, or macOS. By hardcoding logic for dnf, systemd, and GNOME, we achieve blistering speed and absolute reliability. No abstraction layers, no "cross-platform" bloat.

⚡ Pure Go DSL
Why write YAML when you can write type-safe Go? Instead of obscure Ansible modules, we use a custom, lightweight internal library (internal/ops) to handle state:

Go

// Clean, readable, and compiles to a binary.
ops.EnsurePackages("docker", "zsh", "fprintd")
ops.EnsureService("docker")
ops.EnsureSymlink(persistentData+"/Workspace", home+"/Workspace")
workflow: The "Phoenix" Protocol
Nuke: Install a fresh Fedora from Live USB. Format /. Keep LUKS partition untouched.

Download: Pull the latest phoenix binary from your S3/EC2.

Execute:

Bash

sudo ./phoenix
Unlock: Enter your LUKS password once.

Relax: Go grab a coffee. Phoenix will:

Decrypt and mount your work data.

Install all system/dev packages (DNF).

Configure Systemd services & User shell.

Restore dotfiles.

Reborn: Return to a "World Line Restored" environment.
